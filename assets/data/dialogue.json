There you can inspect the items you are currently holding, as well as some other useful information.

To do that, you have to have a seed bag equipped to [{currentInputMapping.item1}] or [{currentInputMapping.item2}]. Once you have planted something, it takes a couple of days to grow. You can inspect the plant to see its current status. Once a plant is ready, you can use a scythe to harvest it. This leaves the patch of soil empty for the next crop. Attention: If you wait too long, crops will eventually start to wilt and you won't get any harvest from them.\f\nUse Fertilizer to raise the yield. How much fertilizer you can use depends on the type of crop.",
