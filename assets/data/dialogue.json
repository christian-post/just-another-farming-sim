Press [{keyMapping.up}], [{keyMapping.down}], [{keyMapping.left}] or [{keyMapping.right}] to walk around. [{keyMapping.item1}], [{keyMapping.item2}] and [{keyMapping.interact}] are the three action buttons.\f\nYou can see what they are currently doing on the top right corner of the sceen. [{keyMapping.interact}] is used to interact with your environment. The buttons [{keyMapping.item1}] and [{keyMapping.item2}] are where you can use your equipped items. While in the inventory, press one of those buttons to equip the currently selected item.\f\nA few meters in front of you there are patches of fertile soil. As a first task, you should equip one of your seed bags and start planting your crops!"
